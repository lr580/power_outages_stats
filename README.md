## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |
